More precisely:
    Both tables must have related columns

Usually:
    Primary key ↔ Foreign key, or
    Columns that represent the same real-world entity

Important points:
    The column names don’t have to be the same
    The data type and meaning must match
    A composite primary key is irrelevant unless all its parts are actually used to relate tables
