This table may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website. 
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
 

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table in any order.
